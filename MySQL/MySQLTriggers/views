A view is a preset query stored in a database. A view could be useful for improved security by restricting the data available to less-privilege users; or producing derived column (such as total prices from unit prices).

Syntax:

CREATE VIEW viewName (columnList) AS selectStatement

Example: Our products table has 5 columns. We can create a view to restrict certain users to two columns, name and price, as follows:
-- Create a VIEW which shows only selected columns
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS products_view;

CREATE VIEW products_view (Name, Price)
AS
SELECT CONCAT(productCode, ' - ', name), price FROM products;

DESCRIBE products_view;
   
SELECT * FROM products_view;

-- Create another VIEW with a derived column
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS products_total_view;
 
CREATE VIEW products_total_view
AS
SELECT
   CONCAT(productCode, ' - ', name) AS Name,
   quantity AS Quantity,
   price AS Price,
   quantity*price AS Total
FROM products;
 
SELECT * FROM products_total_view;
